"""
Step A: print_logs(test_ui_1)

func inside print_logs is the original test_ui_1.

wrapper() inside print_logs runs immediately because of return wrapper().

Prints "Start Logs".

Calls func() ‚Üí runs the original test_ui_1:

Add a function, time taken by this function_1


(sleeps for ~2 seconds).

Prints "End Logs".

wrapper() returns None.

So print_logs(test_ui_1) itself returns None.

Result: after this step, we are effectively calling
time_decor(None).

Step B: time_decor(None)

Now func inside time_decor is None.

wrapper() inside time_decor is defined and immediately executed.

Inside wrapper():

start_time = time.time() ‚Üí prints a timestamp.

func() is attempted‚Ä¶ but func is None.

This causes a runtime error:

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable


That happens while Python is still defining test_ui_1, i.e., during import/initial execution.

5Ô∏è‚É£ What never happens

The name test_ui_1 is never successfully assigned.

You never get a callable function you can run later.

The script stops with a TypeError before finishing.

üü¢ Key Takeaways

Decorators normally return a function, not the result of calling that function.

Correct pattern: return wrapper

Writing return wrapper() calls the wrapper right away and usually returns None.

With stacked decorators, evaluation order is bottom to top:

print_logs runs first, immediately executes the function.

Its return (None) is passed to time_decor.

time_decor then tries to run func(), but func is None, causing an error.
